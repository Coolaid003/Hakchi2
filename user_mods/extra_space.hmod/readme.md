This is mod for SNES Mini which moves your save-states data to unused partition of NAND flash.

This partition is only 50MB in size but it will free some space for games.

Please backup your save-states before using. I am not responsible for them.

*** Please note *** 

Each uncompressed save is on average around 2mb uncompressed. If you are intending to use this mod it is highly recommended that you use CompCom's canoe save compression tool to compress the saves down to approximately 200kb each.

You can find the compression tool here: [Canoe Save Compression Mod](https://github.com/CompCom/hmrepo/raw/master/canoe_save_compress_fast.hmod)

If you experience any issues using this mod, it's recommended that you uninstall it. By moving your saves to the unused partition you run the risk of causing adverse effects to the set up of your mini.
